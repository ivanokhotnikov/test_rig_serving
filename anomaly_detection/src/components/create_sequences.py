    The create_sequences function creates sequences from the input data. The function takes two arguments: values and lookback. Values is a list of floats, lookback is an integer. The output of the function is a numpy array with shape (number_of_sequences, lookback, 1).
    
    Args:
        values: Pass the data to be converted into sequences
        lookback=None: Specify the number of previous time steps to use as input variables to predict the next time period â€” in this case defaulted to none
